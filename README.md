# Optimization Sample Codes

### Elastic Optimization
This is quadratic optimzation problem that is solved by Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP) algorithm defined in Scipy Library.<br>
Objective function: $f(x_1,x_2) = x_1x_2$<br>
constraints: <br>
$25 =< x_1x_2 =< 40$<br>
Lower bound and upper bound:<br>
$0 < x_1,x_2 < 7$<br>
